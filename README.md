# Medical Transcription Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to enhance medical transcription classification using a hybrid approach of N-gram and BERT embeddings. It demonstrates the power of combining traditional NLP techniques with advanced deep learning models to classify medical transcriptions into various disease categories.

## Features
- Integration of N-gram and BERT embeddings for robust text feature extraction.
- Application of machine learning algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest) for effective text classification.
- Utilization of PCA for dimensionality reduction, enhancing model performance.
- Comprehensive evaluation of models with F1-score, precision, and recall metrics.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Medical Transcription Samples (MTSamples) database, comprising 5,000 samples across 40 distinct disease classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow, transformers
